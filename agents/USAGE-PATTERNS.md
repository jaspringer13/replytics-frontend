## üö® Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### **Don't Use Generic Agents for Specific Domains**
```bash
‚ùå Wrong: Use /typescript-enforcer for voice processing issues

‚ùå Wrong: Use /api-route-builder for UI component issues  
‚úÖ Right: Use /ui-component-architect for component problems
```

### **Don't Skip Security Validation**
```bash
‚ùå Wrong: Deploy without security review
‚úÖ Right: Always include security agents in deployment workflow

‚ùå Wrong: Add features without tenant boundary validation
‚úÖ Right: Include /multi-tenant-boundary-enforcer for multi-tenant features
```

### **Don't Use Multiple Agents Simultaneously for Same Task**
```bash
‚ùå Wrong: Ask both /auth-security-expert and /api-route-builder about auth

**üí° Pattern Recognition Tip**: The more specific your task domain, the more specific your agent should be. Start specific, then broaden as needed.
